- 👋 Hi, I’m Prabhash.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development. I am curious on how quantum computing will shape in the future.
- 🌱 I’m studying Machine Learning and the use of neural networks. I am also interested in Heterogeneous Computing which utilized the power of both CPUs and GPUs. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects. I am up for challenging tasks. I hope that would be a great learning curve.
